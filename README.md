# JavaScript-Quiz

## Description

This is a quiz app created in JS. There is a timer that uses the setTimeOut function to rerender the stopwatch. You're penalized by losing 10 seconds from the timer whenever your answer is incorrect. When the timer reaches zero or if the user answers all the questions the game ends and your score will be displayed and you can optionally sumbit your name which will be stored along with your score in Local Storage
